## Aim of the game
The aim of the game is to get from the start pad to the end one. However it is not as simple as it first seems.

All of the tiles are hidden so you can't see what is underneath them, to reveal this you will have to scan the area, giving you a temporary view of what lies below the tiles, which will also drain your battery.

## Screenshots

### Board examples

In these images we can see what the board looks like then it is hidden, right, and then when it is temporarly shown, left.

###  Tile examples

In the bottom two images we can see what each of the tiles do:

- We have different tiles that take battery depending on their indication
- The lightning bolt will fully recharge your battery
- The exclamation mark will drain your battery instantally ( Killing you )
- Cracks will dissapear when you go over them so you can't turn back
